**Kingdom** is a multi-tenant domain manager, where every joined user can create its own domain 
with its own rules and invite any other manager that belongs to the same application.

Kingdom also provides a complete user registration life-cycle, like invitation, login, password recovery and more.

More features soon. For now, you can check the current API Docs:
